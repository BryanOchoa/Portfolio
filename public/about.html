<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Bryan Ochoa, a dedicated father of two and a passionate creative with a rich background in both
   sales and art. For the past decade, I've honed my skills in sales, where attention to detail, 
   persistence, and helping others have been central to my success. Now, I’m channeling that same focus 
   and creativity into building beautiful, functional websites that merge artistry with usability.</p>

  <p>With a lifelong passion for art—especially graffiti—I’ve developed a strong eye for design, color, 
    and composition. My goal is to bring this creativity to web development, crafting visually striking, 
    user-friendly digital experiences. I’m also deeply analytical and have a love for math, which helps 
    me approach every project with precision and meticulous attention to detail.</p>
  
 <p> I believe in hard work and discipline, as reflected by my commitment to hitting the gym at 4 AM, 
  five days a week. This persistence mirrors my approach to web development—consistent, driven, and 
  always striving for improvement.</p>
  
 <p> I’m excited to combine my love for creativity, problem-solving, and helping others to create websites
   that not only look amazing but also provide real value to users.</p>
